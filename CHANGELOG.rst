  * Add some logging statements
  * Add input checks on number of documents and tokens per document
  * Allow target labels to be passed as argument to compute_metrics. Note
      that if a label is predicted and it is not in this list, then it
      will be classed as spurious for the aggregated scores, and on each
      entity level result (because it is unclear where the spurious value
      should be applied, it is applied to all)
  * linting
  * Add many new tests
- Don't evaluate precision and recall for each sentence. [Matthew Upson]

  Rather than automatically calculate precision and recall at the sentence
  level, this change adds a new function compute_precision_recall_wrapper
  which can be run after all the metrics whether for 1 document, or 1000,
  have been calculated. This has the benefit that we can reuse the same
  code for calculating precision/recall, and allows us to calculate entity
  level precision/recall if required.
